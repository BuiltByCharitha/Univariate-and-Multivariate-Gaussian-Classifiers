# Univariate-and-Multivariate-Gaussian-Classifiers

This project focuses on implementing and analyzing Gaussian discriminant analysis for both univariate and multivariate data distributions. The goal is to understand how discriminant functions are derived, computed, and used to classify data points under different covariance and prior assumptions.

The implementation progresses from simple one-dimensional Gaussian models to a generalized multi-class discriminant framework capable of handling higher-dimensional inputs and varying priors.
